# NP32019

NP3_Paper.Rmd is an R markdown document that, when knitted, processes the EEG and behavioural data from an attention/choice task, creates plots, runs statistical tests, and outputs everything as a word document written in the form of a scientific paper.

In this experiment, participants were shown displays on a computer where they could choose which target object they would like to select and respond to. In a given display, we would manipulate factors like the clutter near the various targets, and the difficulty of the judgement that the participant would have to make for that target. We use behavioural measures and EEG measures to observe how participant choice is modulated by these factors, and how this differs for different individuals.
